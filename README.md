## Description

Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) is a computational process that involves identifying sets of items that appear together frequently within a dataset of transactions. These sets of items are termed "itemsets," and the frequency of occurrence is measured against a predefined threshold known as the "minimum support."
The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used in data mining and association rule learning, specifically designed for discovering frequent itemsets within large datasets. It's particularly useful for market basket analysis in retail or any situation where you want to uncover relationships between different items. 

The Apriori algorithm, when implemented using MapReduce, may face certain inefficiencies due to its iterative nature and multiple MapReduce jobs. Intermediate data generated between MapReduce jobs in each iteration can be substantial. Writing this data to disk and reading it for subsequent iterations adds to the overall overhead and disk I/O operations.These inefficiencies can impact its performance, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. Using Spark RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) can offer optimizations over traditional MapReduce for the Apriori algorithm. Spark RDDs enable caching intermediate data in memory, reducing disk I/O by keeping frequently accessed data in memory across iterations. This can significantly speed up iterative algorithms like Apriori for large scale datasets.
